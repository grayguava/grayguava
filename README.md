<h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Hi there 👋🏽</h2>

<p>
I spend most of my time learning by building and experimenting with systems — usually around <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>basic networking</strong>, and small self-hosted or browser-based projects.
I don’t have everything figured out yet; I mostly learn by setting things up, breaking them, and understanding what went wrong.

### 🔧 What I’m currently experimenting with
- General networking concepts (how things connect, route, and fail)
- Linux basics (processes, permissions, services, command-line tools)
- Small virtual labs and local setups
- Trying out cloud concepts at a surface level (just enough to understand what’s happening)

---

#### 📁 What lives in my GitHub
- Small experiments and side projects built out of curiosity
- Repositories that exist mainly to make things work, not to look polished
- Occasional notes or comments when something is likely to be forgotten later
- A few focused tools I built to explore specific ideas:
  - **FormSeal** → an experiment around end-to-end encrypted form submissions
  - **ByteSeal** → a browser-only, offline file encryption tool

---

### 🎯 Direction (very much in progress)
Right now I’m focused on building fundamentals and getting comfortable with how systems behave in practice.
I’m still exploring different areas and figuring out what I want to go deeper into long-term.

---

### 🧩 Fun fact
I break things often — mostly because that’s how I end up learning how they actually work.
