<h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Hi there 👋🏽</h2

<p>
 I work with **computer networking**, **Linux systems**, and **small cloud labs**.  
Most of what I build comes from curiosity — setting up things, breaking them, then fixing them properly.</p>

### 🔧 What I'm exploring right now
- Networking (routing, NAT, DNS, VLANs, port-forwarding)
- Linux internals (processes, permissions, services, networking tools)
- Virtualized labs (VirtualBox topologies, multi-node experiments)
- Early cloud fundamentals (IAM, VPC networking, compute/storage)

---

### 📁 What lives in my GitHub
- Notes + diagrams for networking and Linux
- Lab configs, troubleshooting write-ups, and scripts
- Logs tracking what I learn each week  
- Infrastructure/security side-projects  
  - **FormSeal** → E2EE contact-form framework using Cloudflare Workers, KV, and Ed25519

---

### 🎯 Direction
Strengthening networking and Linux fundamentals → building repeatable labs → expanding into cloud infrastructure.  
Security comes naturally once the base is strong.

---

### 🧩 Fun fact
I break more things than I fix — but the things I fix stay fixed.
