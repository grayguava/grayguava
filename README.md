# 

I’m learning **computer networking**, **Linux systems**, and the **foundations of cloud computing** through hands-on labs and small experiments.

My focus right now is building a strong technical base before moving deeper into cloud infrastructure and security.

---

## 🧩 What I’m currently learning
- Networking fundamentals (subnets, routing, NAT, DNS, VLANs)
- Linux basics (CLI, permissions, processes, filesystem)
- Virtualization & lab setups (VirtualBox, simple network topologies)
- Beginner AWS/Azure concepts (IAM, VPC/Virtual Networks, compute, storage)

---

## 🛠️ What you’ll find here
- Notes and diagrams for networking, Linux, and cloud fundamentals
- Small lab configurations and experiments
- Logs documenting what I learn each week
- Simple scripts or configs created while studying

---

## 🎯 Current goals
- Strengthen networking + Linux fundamentals
- Build small, repeatable cloud labs
- Document everything clearly
- Grow toward a cloud/infrastructure role

---

## 🧭 Long-term direction
Networking → Cloud Foundations → Cloud Infrastructure → Security (later)
